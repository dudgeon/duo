## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-26

The inaugural release. The bar for "should this exist as a labelled
version?" was not "is it stable" or "does it have users" — neither
applies pre-distribution. The bar was: **does the code base have
enough internal coherence that a labelled snapshot would be useful
to refer back to?** It does. The foundation layer (Stages 1–3, 5,
8, 9), the editor surfaces (11a, 12 phases 1–3, 13, 17a + polish +
b + c + d-A), the agent CLI (Stage 3 + 17 verbs), the subagent
(Stage 5 v2), and the agent-detection signals (19a + 19c) all hang
together. v0.1.0 freezes that.

### Why v0.1.0 lands here

Two months of build with no prior version-management discipline
left the project in a state where "what shipped when" lived only in
`docs/dev/session-log.md` and the roadmap's stage-status flips. As
the FTUX-coordinated trio (Stage 18 + 18b + 23 + 24) approaches —
the first real Trailblazer-facing surface — version discipline
becomes load-bearing: a Trailblazer who installs Duo and reports a
bug needs to be able to say "I'm on v0.x" and have that mean
something. Cutting v0.1.0 *before* Stage 18 ships means the process
is exercised on low-stakes ground (no users yet, mistakes
recoverable) and the first user-facing release will already have a
working version-cut machinery behind it.

### Key design decisions baked in

- **Three-pane layout** (Stage 10 ADR). Files left, terminal middle, working pane right. The working pane is polymorphic: a single tab strip handles browser pages, markdown editors, HTML canvases, image viewers, PDFs. This was a deliberate departure from "one tab strip per modality" — the bet is that humans don't think about file types, they think about "what am I looking at right now."
- **Duo subagent uses Haiku 4.5, not Sonnet** (Stage 5 v2). The PRD's "~85% token reduction" hypothesis didn't survive synthetic measurement (FOLLOWUP-003 — Claude Code already routes mechanical work to Haiku, so the subagent stacks a second Haiku layer rather than replacing Sonnet). Qualitative wins (bounded context per task, specialized prompt, clear contract) carried the architecture instead.
- **HTML canvas serializer scrubs runtime classes** (Stage 17c). The "saved file is just HTML" guarantee is load-bearing — the canvas is supposed to feel like a primitive, not a system. Comment chrome (`data-duo-comment-anchor`, `duo-comment-anchor` class) and just-added wash (`duo-just-added` class) NEVER leak to disk. V27 in the verification punch list watches this; if it ever fails, the canvas's "primitive" framing is lost.
- **CSS Custom Highlight Registry for blurred selection** (Stage 17c). When the user selects text in the canvas and clicks into the terminal, the selection still paints in the Atelier mark color. Implemented via the Highlight Registry API (Chromium 105+) — no DOM mutation, no false-dirty. The fallback (span overlay) would dirty the buffer; that's the V20 watch.
- **`duo external` routes off-host URLs through the OS default browser** (Stage 5 v2). Trailblazers are PMs at Cap One — they have corporate-managed browsers with internal sites, SSO, and bookmarks. Duo's embedded Chromium can't replicate that surface, so the explicit decision was: Duo is for in-loop work (browse → quote → ask Claude); off-host links go to the user's real browser via `shell.openExternal`.

### What v0.1.0 is and isn't

**Is:** an internal-development snapshot of the foundation. Runnable
via `npm run dev` or installable via the uncert DMG produced by
`npm run dist`. The CLI works (`duo` is a tracked binary in
`cli/duo`). The skill (`skill/SKILL.md`) and subagent
(`agents/duo.md`) sync into `~/.claude/` via `npm run sync:claude`.

**Isn't:** distributable to anyone other than the owner.
First-launch self-install (Stage 18) hasn't shipped — installing
this build on a fresh machine leaves the user without `duo` on
their PATH and without the skill / agent installed. The DMG isn't
signed or notarized (Stage 21) — Gatekeeper will warn. There's no
auto-update channel. There's no FAQ surface, no "what does this do"
landing page (those ship in v0.2.0 as part of the FTUX trio).

### What's queued next (v0.2.0 candidate scope)

- **Verification debt** — V2–V27 + 19c full UI walk (V1 done, BUG-009 filed during the v0.1.0 cut walk).
- **FTUX-coordinated trio** — Stage 18 (first-launch self-install), Stage 18b (distro skill packs), Stage 23 (canvas actions — `data-duo-action` Claude↔HTML loop), Stage 24 (pin WorkingPane tabs).
- **`faq.html` + `what-duo-does.html`** — the user-facing reference surfaces; replace about:blank as the default new-tab landing; both use the `<meta name="duo-open-in" content="browser">` routing convention and `<meta name="duo-editable" content="false">` read-only convention.
- **BUG-008 + BUG-009** — `⌘T`-from-terminal-focus xterm-eats-keystroke (resolve spec conflict with Stage 19c first), and `+ → claude` newline race.

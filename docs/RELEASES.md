## Pending — not yet cut

_Empty. The deferred v0.2.0 draft folded into the v0.2.0 cut below
once Stage 24 + Stage 18 (Phase 1 + 2) + the BUG-008 squash brought
the chapter to a close._

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-26

The FTUX foundation. v0.1.0 was the inaugural inventory snapshot;
v0.2.0 is the first release where a Trailblazer could actually pick
up Duo and use it without a developer hand-holding them through
manual filesystem setup.

### Why v0.2.0 lands here

The proposal-and-defer cycle on this version is itself instructive.
A v0.2.0 cut was first proposed after three coherent post-v0.1.0
commits (faq.html landing, BUG-009 fix, duo-editable honoring) and
the owner deferred with "this is not a release yet — keep building."
That recalibrated the cut-version skill's bar (the project's not
ready to cut every three commits — needs "a chapter has ended").
Stage 24 (pin tabs) + the BUG-008 squash + Stage 18 Phase 2 (CLI
binary on PATH) closed that chapter — the FTUX foundation is now a
single coherent surface a new user can land on.

### Key design decisions baked in

- **`~/.local/bin/duo` for the CLI install path** (Stage 18 Phase 2). No sudo required, conventional XDG-style location, sandbox-friendly. Trade-off: macOS zsh doesn't have it on PATH by default, so the install banner surfaces a one-liner (`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`) when we detect the gap. Avoided `/usr/local/bin/duo` to keep the install surface non-privileged.
- **`⌘T` flipped from pane-aware to universal browser-tab** (BUG-008 resolution). Stage 19c had specced `⌘T` from terminal focus → claude tab, on the theory that a non-technical PM in a shell would discover Claude faster. The owner's call: universal mental-model wins, discovery affordance lives on the `+` button instead. `⌘⇧T` becomes the keyboard chord for Claude tabs.
- **Two declarative routing metas (`duo-open-in`, `duo-editable`)** instead of an in-app config / file-naming convention. A reference HTML carries its own routing intent, no central registry. The file-open dispatcher does a 4KB head-read pre-flight to honor `duo-open-in`; the canvas mounts read with `contentEditable` off when `duo-editable=false`. Both extensible to user-authored docs (e.g. an in-team SOP marked `duo-editable=false` so accidental edits don't happen).
- **`waitForPtyReady` helper** (BUG-009 fix) replaces `queueMicrotask`. Resolves on the new tab's first PTY data event (= shell emitted SOMETHING, plausibly PS1) plus a 30ms paint settle. The cosmetic residual (BUG-010, filed) is that the shell can emit something BEFORE PS1 — e.g. terminal-init escape codes — tripping the helper early. Functional fix is real; visual polish owed.
- **Pin storage at `~/.claude/duo/pins.json`** with file-tabs identified by absolute path and browser-tabs by URL. Atomic tmp+rename writes. Foundation for Stage 18b's `PACK.json § pins` distro pre-pins (next stage) and Stage 21c's session-restore highest-priority entries.

### What v0.2.0 is and isn't

**Is:** the first release where a fresh `Duo.app` install gets a
Trailblazer to a working state in one click. Welcome banner
installs the skill / subagent / help-files into `~/.claude/` and the
`duo` CLI binary into `~/.local/bin/`. Default browser landing is the
FAQ instead of about:blank. Pin support means a reference HTML can
stay leftmost across sessions.

**Isn't:** distribution-ready. The DMG is unsigned (Stage 21
deferred); there's no GitHub Releases publish step (manual hand-off
only); no auto-update channel; no distro-supplied skill packs (Stage
18b deferred). The V2–V27 canvas verification walk inherited from
v0.1.0 still owed in eyes-on form.

### What's queued next (v0.3.0 candidate scope)

**🔖 Owner-flagged priority:** **Stage 19b** at the top.

- **Stage 19b — passive priming (PRIORITY).** SessionStart hook + PATH shim + `priming.md` in `~/.claude/`. The remaining piece of the Stage 19 family: when a Claude Code session starts inside a Duo PTY, hand it Duo-specific priming (skill discovery hints, `duo` CLI on PATH already, ambient context) so the agent doesn't need to be told "you're in Duo." Originally specced to fold into the Stage 18 installer; keeping it 19b keeps the flag visible.
- **Stage 18b** — distro skill packs (`extra-skills/` + `PACK.json` + per-conflict consent UI). Cap One AIP starter pack is the worked example.
- **Stage 23** — canvas actions (`data-duo-action` Claude↔HTML loop). Pairs with 18b for the FTUX welcome page.
- **Stage 25** — post-redirect chrome banner (small, ~80 LOC).
- **Stage 19d** — mid-tab launch-claude banner (small, for shell-tab discovery).
- **BUG-010** — replace `waitForPtyReady`'s "first data" trigger with a prompt-shape regex.
- **V2–V27 verification walk** — still owed from v0.1.0; Stage 18 + 24 + BUG-008/009 walked PASS in v0.2.0 smoke.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-26

The inaugural release. The bar for "should this exist as a labelled
version?" was not "is it stable" or "does it have users" — neither
applies pre-distribution. The bar was: **does the code base have
enough internal coherence that a labelled snapshot would be useful
to refer back to?** It does. The foundation layer (Stages 1–3, 5,
8, 9), the editor surfaces (11a, 12 phases 1–3, 13, 17a + polish +
b + c + d-A), the agent CLI (Stage 3 + 17 verbs), the subagent
(Stage 5 v2), and the agent-detection signals (19a + 19c) all hang
together. v0.1.0 freezes that.

### Why v0.1.0 lands here

Two months of build with no prior version-management discipline
left the project in a state where "what shipped when" lived only in
`docs/dev/session-log.md` and the roadmap's stage-status flips. As
the FTUX-coordinated trio (Stage 18 + 18b + 23 + 24) approaches —
the first real Trailblazer-facing surface — version discipline
becomes load-bearing: a Trailblazer who installs Duo and reports a
bug needs to be able to say "I'm on v0.x" and have that mean
something. Cutting v0.1.0 *before* Stage 18 ships means the process
is exercised on low-stakes ground (no users yet, mistakes
recoverable) and the first user-facing release will already have a
working version-cut machinery behind it.

### Key design decisions baked in

- **Three-pane layout** (Stage 10 ADR). Files left, terminal middle, working pane right. The working pane is polymorphic: a single tab strip handles browser pages, markdown editors, HTML canvases, image viewers, PDFs. This was a deliberate departure from "one tab strip per modality" — the bet is that humans don't think about file types, they think about "what am I looking at right now."
- **Duo subagent uses Haiku 4.5, not Sonnet** (Stage 5 v2). The PRD's "~85% token reduction" hypothesis didn't survive synthetic measurement (FOLLOWUP-003 — Claude Code already routes mechanical work to Haiku, so the subagent stacks a second Haiku layer rather than replacing Sonnet). Qualitative wins (bounded context per task, specialized prompt, clear contract) carried the architecture instead.
- **HTML canvas serializer scrubs runtime classes** (Stage 17c). The "saved file is just HTML" guarantee is load-bearing — the canvas is supposed to feel like a primitive, not a system. Comment chrome (`data-duo-comment-anchor`, `duo-comment-anchor` class) and just-added wash (`duo-just-added` class) NEVER leak to disk. V27 in the verification punch list watches this; if it ever fails, the canvas's "primitive" framing is lost.
- **CSS Custom Highlight Registry for blurred selection** (Stage 17c). When the user selects text in the canvas and clicks into the terminal, the selection still paints in the Atelier mark color. Implemented via the Highlight Registry API (Chromium 105+) — no DOM mutation, no false-dirty. The fallback (span overlay) would dirty the buffer; that's the V20 watch.
- **`duo external` routes off-host URLs through the OS default browser** (Stage 5 v2). Trailblazers are PMs at Cap One — they have corporate-managed browsers with internal sites, SSO, and bookmarks. Duo's embedded Chromium can't replicate that surface, so the explicit decision was: Duo is for in-loop work (browse → quote → ask Claude); off-host links go to the user's real browser via `shell.openExternal`.

### What v0.1.0 is and isn't

**Is:** an internal-development snapshot of the foundation. Runnable
via `npm run dev` or installable via the uncert DMG produced by
`npm run dist`. The CLI works (`duo` is a tracked binary in
`cli/duo`). The skill (`skill/SKILL.md`) and subagent
(`agents/duo.md`) sync into `~/.claude/` via `npm run sync:claude`.

**Isn't:** distributable to anyone other than the owner.
First-launch self-install (Stage 18) hasn't shipped — installing
this build on a fresh machine leaves the user without `duo` on
their PATH and without the skill / agent installed. The DMG isn't
signed or notarized (Stage 21) — Gatekeeper will warn. There's no
auto-update channel. There's no FAQ surface, no "what does this do"
landing page (those ship in v0.2.0 as part of the FTUX trio).

### What's queued next (v0.2.0 candidate scope)

- **Verification debt** — V2–V27 + 19c full UI walk (V1 done, BUG-009 filed during the v0.1.0 cut walk).
- **FTUX-coordinated trio** — Stage 18 (first-launch self-install), Stage 18b (distro skill packs), Stage 23 (canvas actions — `data-duo-action` Claude↔HTML loop), Stage 24 (pin WorkingPane tabs).
- **`faq.html` + `what-duo-does.html`** — the user-facing reference surfaces; replace about:blank as the default new-tab landing; both use the `<meta name="duo-open-in" content="browser">` routing convention and `<meta name="duo-editable" content="false">` read-only convention.
- **BUG-008 + BUG-009** — `⌘T`-from-terminal-focus xterm-eats-keystroke (resolve spec conflict with Stage 19c first), and `+ → claude` newline race.

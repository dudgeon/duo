## What this project is

A macOS desktop app ("Duo") that pairs multiple Claude Code terminal sessions
with an embedded Chrome browser, connected by a local CLI bridge (`duo`) so
Claude Code can read and drive the browser as naturally as it runs shell commands.

Owner: Geoff (Capital One, AI in Product program)  
Brief: `duo-brief.md` (read this first — it's comprehensive and locked)

## Current state (as of 2026-04-25)

**Foundation shipped. Flagship half #1 (cozy-mode terminal) shipped
2026-04-22, graduated 2026-04-25 (`(preview)` label dropped).
Flagship half #2 — sub-stage 11a of the markdown editor — shipped
2026-04-24; 11a tail (3 items) and 11b–e next.**

**Latest session (2026-04-25):**
- Stage 9 cozy mode graduated — daily-driver validation passed; menu
  label, PRD, ROADMAP all updated.
- Stage 15g PRD ([docs/prd/stage-15g-send-to-duo.md](docs/prd/stage-15g-send-to-duo.md))
  refined — G10 payload format locked to **A** (quote + provenance);
  G19 added making the format runtime-configurable via the new P1
  CLI verb `duo selection-format [a|b|c]` so agents can opt into
  format C (opaque tokens) for compact multi-step sessions.
- Open ADR "Skill scoping" resolved — locked to global
  `~/.claude/skills/duo/`. Per-session alternatives kept on the
  books in DECISIONS.md for future reference.
- Two thematic commits pushed (`feat(editor+theme)` + `docs`),
  rebased over upstream skill-sandbox-troubleshooting commit.

**Foundation (shipped + verified):**
- Electron main process, preload, PTY manager
- Three-column layout (Files / Terminal / WorkingPane) with one unified
  tab strip across browser + editor + preview tab types
- Terminal tabs (xterm.js + node-pty) with cozy mode typography
- Browser pane (`WebContentsView`, SSO via `persist:duo-browser`, tab
  strip, shortcut forwarding for the allowlisted `⌘<letter>` set)
- File navigator (Stage 10) — shared tree, breadcrumb, pending-CWD for
  new terminal tabs, follow-mode
- Theme toggle — System / Light / Dark; follows macOS appearance in
  System mode; xterm terminal theme swapped in lock-step (so the
  terminal isn't white-on-black in light mode)
- `duo` CLI over a Unix socket at
  `~/Library/Application Support/duo/duo.sock` (mode 0700). Full
  inventory + gap roadmap in [docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md](docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md).
- Markdown editor (Stage 11a): TipTap/ProseMirror, tiptap-markdown
  round-trip with frontmatter preservation, table contextual toolbar,
  syntax-highlighted code, `⌘N` new-file flow with filename
  interstitial + focus-to-prose on commit, persistent selection
  overlay across focus changes, `⌘S` + autosave, dirty dot
- Bundled `duo` Claude Code skill + `duo-browser` subagent

**CLI verbs shipped (see [docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md](docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md) for
the authoritative inventory):** navigate · open · url · title · dom ·
text · ax · click · fill · focus · type · key · eval · screenshot ·
console · tabs · tab · close · wait · view · reveal · ls · nav-state ·
edit · selection · doc write · theme · install

**What's next (see `ROADMAP.md` + `docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md`):**

⚠️ **Owner has not yet picked the next sprint focus.** The first thing
to do in a fresh session is ask Geoff which of these to tackle. Each
is roughly the same scope (1–2 sessions of focused work):

1. **Stage 15g.1 — Send → Duo button + `duo send` + `duo selection-format`.**
   Editor-side BubbleMenu + the two new CLI verbs. Builds directly on
   what 11a shipped. PRD is fully spec'd
   ([docs/prd/stage-15g-send-to-duo.md](docs/prd/stage-15g-send-to-duo.md));
   G10 locked, no decision gate before kickoff. **Highest-leverage
   unlock for the human↔agent pair primitive.**
2. **Stage 11a tail — frontmatter properties panel + drag-drop images
   + slash menu / floating bubble.** Closes the editor's UX gaps.
   Smaller PRs each. No new agent capabilities.
3. **Stage 11b — external-write reconciliation + agent-write
   transient highlight.** First sub-stage of the editor's "agent edits
   the same file" story. Bigger; needs a real chokidar wiring + 3-pane
   diff UI. PRD § 6 has the spec.
4. **P0 CLI gaps** — `duo doc read` (live buffer, not disk), browser
   `duo selection`, `duo network`, `duo errors`. Pure agent-API
   expansion; no UI work. Useful before more user-facing surfaces
   ship. See [docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md § Browser observability](docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md).

**Lower-priority follow-ups** (Stage 12 unified skill/connector surface,
Stage 13 polish + `duo doctor` + TCP fallback, Stage 15a–f primitives,
Stage 14 distribution) all wait until at least one of the above lands.

**Known issues live in [`tasks.md`](tasks.md).** As of 2026-04-25:
BUG-001 — `⌃Tab` from terminal focus cycles browser tabs instead of
terminal tabs. Workaround for users: `⌘⇧]` cycles terminal tabs
forward.

## Working style — Claude instances must follow these

1. **Ask before deciding.** Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool whenever there is a meaningful choice to make — layout, UX behaviour, approach, prioritisation, open questions. Do not silently pick one option and implement it. Batch related questions (up to 4 per call) so Geoff can answer them in one shot and you can proceed without interruption.

2. **Do not re-debate the stack.** Electron, xterm.js, WebContentsView, Unix socket CLI — all locked. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

3. **The CLI is the spec.** Every time a new CLI command is added, update `cli/duo.ts`, `skill/SKILL.md`, and **[docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md](docs/CLI-COVERAGE.md)** (the authoritative inventory + gap roadmap). `duo-brief.md §9` holds the original Stage-1–3 draft for historical context but is no longer updated with new verbs.

4. **CLI parity with UI — every user-facing feature ships a `duo` counterpart.** If the human can do it with a click, a menu, a keystroke, or a UI toggle, the agent must be able to do the same thing from the CLI. This is load-bearing for the whole product: Duo's premise is human↔agent pair work on shared surfaces, and a UI-only feature silently breaks that premise. Concrete patterns:
    - UI toggle → `duo <thing>` reads state, `duo <thing> <value>` sets it (example: `duo theme`, `duo theme system|light|dark`).
    - Menu action → `duo <verb>` runs the same action.
    - In-app shortcut that changes state → `duo <verb>` does the same without the keystroke.
    - **Agent-tunable runtime settings** (no UI surface, agent-only): same `duo <thing> [value]` shape, persisted in localStorage. The agent calls it at the start of a session to pick the mode that suits its workflow (example: `duo selection-format [a|b|c]` for Stage 15g's Send → Duo payload format). When you build one of these, check if there's a *user* parallel; if there isn't yet, document the asymmetry in the PRD so a later UI surface can be added without breaking the CLI shape.
    - Deliberately UI-only features (e.g. drag-to-reorder) must be called out in the PRD as explicit asymmetries.

    Plumbing checklist for a new CLI verb — every one of these must be touched:
    1. `shared/types.ts` — add the command name to `DuoCommandName`, plus any new IPC channel / state-snapshot shape
    2. `electron/preload.ts` — expose a minimal renderer API (push / subscribe)
    3. `electron/main.ts` — ipcMain handler for state push; dispatch helper for main→renderer pushes; bridge-exposed getter/setter
    4. `electron/socket-server.ts` — new case in the command switch; extend `NavBridge` if it needs renderer state or a renderer dispatch
    5. `cli/duo.ts` — the verb itself + `printHelp()` update
    6. `skill/SKILL.md` — so the agent discovers it (plus `npm run sync:claude`)

5. **The skill is a first-class deliverable.** Ship both the app and `skill/SKILL.md`, or neither. The skill is how Claude Code discovers the tool.

6. **If blocked on an open question in `duo-brief.md §7`, state the assumption and proceed.** Do not stall waiting for clarification on layout, aesthetics, or naming.

7. **Stage order matters.** Do not try to implement Stage 3 before Stage 2 is working. The socket server is useless without a real browser.

8. **NEVER claim UI work is done without previewing it yourself.** Build
   passing and types clean are not sufficient evidence that a UI change
   works. Before saying "shipped" / "done" on anything that touches the
   renderer, main process, preload, CSS, or menus:

   - Confirm `npm run dev` is running. The dev-server log is tailable at
     `/private/tmp/claude-501/…/tasks/<hash>.output` (look for the
     process spawning `electron-vite dev`).
   - **If `preload.ts` or `electron/main.ts` changed, relaunch Electron**
     — HMR only covers the renderer. Either kill and restart the dev
     server, or ask the user to Cmd+Q and restart.
   - Use computer-use (`request_access` for Electron, then `screenshot`)
     to **actually see the window**. Then walk
     [`docs/dev/smoke-checklist.md`](docs/dev/smoke-checklist.md) — it
     covers the boot path, terminal, files pane breadcrumb nav, working
     pane, keyboard shortcuts from *both* terminal and browser focus,
     cozy mode, and the agent CLI bridge.
   - Include in the end-of-task summary the "saw in the live app" block
     from the checklist's reporting template. If I can't fill it in, the
     task isn't done.
   - If the change set is wide enough that spot-checks won't cover it,
     propose a dedicated regression spike to the user **before** calling
     the stage complete.

   The user lost time on Stage 9 because I shipped code that typechecked
   but crashed the renderer at mount time. That is exactly what a
   two-minute preview pass would have caught.

9. **After editing `skill/` or `agents/`, sync to `~/.claude/`.** The repo
   tracks the canonical source, but Claude Code running on this machine
   reads from `~/.claude/skills/duo/` and `~/.claude/agents/duo-browser.md`.
   These are plain-file **copies**, not symlinks — edits in the repo do
   not propagate automatically. After any change to `skill/SKILL.md`,
   `skill/examples/*.md`, or `agents/duo-browser.md`, run:

   ```bash
   npm run sync:claude
   ```

   This copies the repo versions into `~/.claude/` so live Claude Code
   sessions — including whatever session is driving this repo — pick up
   the change on their next skill / subagent lookup. If you don't sync,
   your edits are invisible until the user either restarts their Claude
   Code session or manually re-copies. The rule applies equally to edits
   the user makes by hand: remind them to `npm run sync:claude` after any
   manual edit.

   End users don't run this script — they get the skill + agent from the
   Stage 6 first-launch installer (which does its own `fs.copyFile` from
   the app bundle into `~/.claude/`). `sync:claude` is a dev-only
   convenience.

## Claude Code sandbox — must read before touching transport, install, or CLI file I/O

Claude Code runs each Bash tool call inside a macOS Seatbelt sandbox that
(a) blocks writes outside the working directory, (b) gates
Unix-domain-socket outbound connections behind an explicit
`allowUnixSockets: true`, and (c) permits localhost TCP. Duo's entire
agent-side bridge today is a single Unix socket at
`~/Library/Application Support/duo/duo.sock` — which means **every `duo`
command silently fails inside a sandboxed Claude Code session**.
The user sees a hung or `ECONNREFUSED` Bash call with no hint that the
sandbox is the cause.

Before changing any code in `cli/duo.ts`, `electron/socket-server.ts`,
the install path, or the skill's troubleshooting guidance, read
`docs/DECISIONS.md` → Open ADRs → **Sandbox-tolerant transport and
install paths for the `duo` CLI**. That ADR inventories what breaks,
explains the `dudgeon/chrome-cdp-skill` precedent (localhost TCP +
auth-token file), and names the planned direction: TCP fallback
alongside the Unix socket, `duo doctor` diagnostic,
`~/.claude/bin/duo` as the preferred install target, skill-docs
troubleshooting section, and a bundled settings fragment. Roadmap
items cross-reference the ADR from Stages 5, 13, and 14.

The work is planful and roadmap-aligned — not a patch. If you find a
new sandbox failure mode not listed in the ADR, add it there rather
than routing around it ad hoc.

## Pre-built CLI binary (`cli/duo`)

`cli/duo` is a compiled esbuild bundle intentionally tracked in git so Geoff
can install the CLI without running a build step (`node cli/duo install`).

**If you change `cli/duo.ts`**, you must regenerate and commit the binary:
```bash
npm run build:cli   # rebuilds cli/duo from cli/duo.ts
git add cli/duo && git commit -m "build: regenerate cli/duo binary"
```

---

## Build commands

```bash
npm install          # installs deps + rebuilds node-pty for Electron
npm run dev          # launch app in dev mode (HMR)
npm run build        # production build → out/
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking (no emit)
npm run dist         # build + package as macOS DMG → dist/
```

---

## Architecture in one paragraph

One Electron main process owns everything: the `BrowserWindow`, the `PtyManager`
(node-pty pool), the `BrowserManager` (WebContentsView, Stage 2), the `CdpBridge`
(Chrome DevTools Protocol commands, Stage 3), and the `SocketServer` (Unix socket
listener, Stage 3). The renderer process hosts React — it shows xterm.js terminals
and a placeholder browser pane, communicating with the main process via contextBridge
IPC. The `duo` CLI (a standalone Node.js script) connects over the Unix socket to
send CDP commands from inside any terminal tab, making the browser programmable from
Claude Code.

## Locked decisions (from owner)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| App name | Duo — CLI is `duo`, skill at `~/.claude/skills/duo/` |
| CLI packaging | esbuild compiled binary — no Node.js on user's PATH needed |
| Browser tabs | Visible tab strip inside BrowserPane; also drivable via `duo tab <n>` from the CLI |
| Brainstem / MCP | **Not included** — Skills panel is CWD-scan only |
| Stage 2 + 3 | Implemented together in one pass |
| Skills panel layout | Collapsible sidebar — third column right of browser pane (scanner implemented; UI not yet wired) |
| Skills CWD source | PTY launch CWD (not moving shell CWD); two scopes: project + home |
| First-launch install | Electron permission dialog before installing CLI + skill + agent (deferred; currently manual) |
| Distribution / cert | No cert yet — personal use only; get cert before Stage 6 |

## Open questions needing Geoff's input

| Question | Priority |
|---|---|
| Apple Developer ID cert | Before Stage 6 |
| Distribution timeline (personal → Trailblazers) | Before Stage 6 |
| Socket auth approach for Trailblazers | Before Stage 6 |
